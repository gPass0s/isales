## Insight Sales | HubSpot Project
==================================

This project aims to create an automated and near real time service that predicts a company HubSpot 
leads probability to buy products. In its main core, this project uses a XGboost model that was 
trained with more than 10 thousands HubSpot leads records. 

In order to receive data from Hubspot, this project counts on a Google Cloud Function that works
as producer sending data to a Redis queue. The GCP function is subscribed to HubSpot through a 
webhook service that triggers the function anytime a contact is created or a deal property is edited. 
Then, this project's module **fetcher** reads the Redis queue and injects the data that is coming in 
from Hubspot into the trained Xgboost model. 

Finally, predictions generated by the model are written in the Hubspotâ€™s database in order to help 
sellers to decide which leads they should invest their time in.
