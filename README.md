## Insight Sales | HubSpot Project
==================================

This project aims to create an automated and near real time service that predicts HubSpot contact's probability to buy exchange program packages. In its main core, this project uses a XGboost model that was 
trained with more than 10 thousands HubSpot leads records. 

In order to receive data from Hubspot, this project uses a Google Cloud Function which works
as a producer sending data to a Redis queue. The GCP function is subscribed to HubSpot through a 
webhook service that triggers this function everytime a contact is created or modified. 
Then, this project's **collector** module reads the Redis queue, fetches contacts main information in HS database and sends all this data to the **preprocessor** module. Next,the preprocessor module enhances the fetched data for the prediction stage. After all that, the **model** module predicts lead's
propability to buy an exchange program by using a Xgboost machine learning model. 

Finally, predictions generated by the ML model are sent to Hubspot database by the **sender** module.
These predicitons help sellers to decide which contacts they should invest their time.
