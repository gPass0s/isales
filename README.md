## Insight Sales | HubSpot Project
==================================

This project aims to create an automated and near real time service that predicts HubSpot contact's probability to buy exchange program packages. In its main core, this project uses a XGboost model that was 
trained with more than 10 thousands HubSpot leads records. 

In order to receive data from Hubspot, this project uses a Google Cloud Function which works
as a producer sending data to a Redis queue. The GCP function is subscribed to HubSpot through a 
webhook service that triggers this function everytime a contact is created or modified. 
Then, this project's **collector** module reads the Redis queue, fetches contacts main information in HS database through http requests and sends all this data to the **preprocessor** module. The preprocessor module enhances the fetched data that is going to be predicted by the Xgboost machine learning model. 

Finally, predictions generated by the ML model are written in the Hubspotâ€™s database in order to help 
sellers to decide which contacts they should invest their time.
